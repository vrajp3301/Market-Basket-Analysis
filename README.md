## Market Basket Analysis Techniques

### 1. Data Exploration and Visualization

The notebook employs classical methods of data visualization to provide insights into the dataset. This includes graphical representation of transaction patterns, product popularity, and customer behavior.

### 2. Apriori Algorithm

The Apriori algorithm, a widely used technique in MBA, is applied to discover association rules between products. These rules highlight relationships and dependencies among items in the market basket.

### 3. Standard Indicators

Various standard indicators are used to quantify the significance and strength of associations, allowing for the identification of key patterns within the dataset.

### 4. Rules of Association

Association rules are derived from the analysis, providing actionable insights into which products tend to be purchased together. These rules serve as a basis for strategic decision-making in marketing and sales.

### 5. Aggregation and Pruning

The notebook demonstrates the importance of aggregation and pruning techniques to refine the analysis results, ensuring that only meaningful and relevant patterns are considered.

### 6. Dynamic Graph Visualization

Associative rules are visualized in the form of a dynamic graph, making it easier to interpret and communicate the discovered relationships.
